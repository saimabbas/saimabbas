I am a Freelance React Frontend Developer based in Multan, Pakistan. I am also employed as a Snior Frontend Engineer in 5D solutions, Dubai LLC where I manage frontend team, . Looking 5 years back when i starting my web development journey, I see myself hadling projects of start-ups and big enterprises, tackling comples bugs in frontend and API Integration and going through tons of challenges in web development and freelancing. However, going through all those bugs helped me becoming a developer who can handle any frontend challenge coming my way.
